# PSET

A React Native application designed for transaction signing and management. This project includes features such as signing transactions, analyzing PSETs (Partially Signed Elements Transactions), exporting PSETs, sharing signed transactions, sending and receiving L-BTC, viewing transaction history, and assets list.

The application supports two methods for signing transactions: signing/analyzing PSETs using a mnemonic or analyzing PSETs using descriptors.

NOTE: Sign by Jade is coming later.

## Installation

### For iOS

```bash
npm i

cd ios
pod install
cd ..

yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.
